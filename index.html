			<p class="intro">It teaches you how to think?, You might have heard these lines by steve jobs. Competitive programming is a long journey. It takes lot of efforts, preparation and training of months to become pro in this game. It teaches you to think of a brute force solution of a problem and then how to optimize the code further to take as less memory and time as possible. Competitive programming teaches to figure out corner cases and bugs in the program quickly.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intro">Programming a challenging role and once we enter into a industry we will get to solve new problems on our own with the skills we learn during competitive programming preparation.In industry we have to solved problems no one had solved before that. We have to solve problems which takes less memory and time using problem solving and logical ability. So the one and clear goal behind these competitive programming is <b>“To prepare a programmer such that his/her logical ability increases and we are able to write code for the challenging situation.”</b>
			Another reason is that a lot of big companies which are known as FAANG like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google hires through competitive programming so if you want to get into these companies then you really need to prepare in competitive programming. It doesn’t matter whether you are a newbie programmer or you have written some code before, we will tell you some steps, approaches, and tips to prepare yourself for competitive programming.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intro">To start with competitive programming one must be good with :</p>
			<ul type="bullet" class="intro">
				<li>One programming language syntax (recommended C++/Java/Python).</li>
				<li>Time and space complexity algorithms analysis.</li>
				<li>Ability to think about a Brute Force Solution.</li>
				<li>Good hold over few Data Structures like Array, List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Trie etc.</li>
